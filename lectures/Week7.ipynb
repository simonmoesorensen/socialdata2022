    "Last week you had an intro to classification tasks and decision trees. You worked on a model to predict criminal recidivism and made a few visualizations along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you asked: why Machine Learning? And, even though modeling is part of analysing data and predictions are a huge part of how people use data nowadays, there is something more important to it: visualization are not only powerful to study data, they are also great to understand models. We needed that little extra Machine Learning to explore another way of using visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will do exactly this! The purpose of today's class is threefold: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To explore the data I gave you last week with **interactive visualizations**;\n",
    "2. To **visualize the results** on criminal recidivism of your machine learning model;\n",
    "3. To **debias** the results you obtained via two methods (and a bit of visualization along the way). "

    "\n",
    "Until today we have worked with static data visualization. However, exploratory data analysis means to be able to explore the multi-faceted nature of data and *interactive dataviz* is a handy tool to do it! It allows to play with the data: Toggle the view. Zoom. Drag. Show more details. All those things. Those are a key part of modern data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "To really master interactive visualizations, you should check out methods in JavaScript, especially [D3](https://d3js.org). Given that we only have 5ECTS for this class, we unfortunately don't have time for that. But luckily Python has some pretty good options for interactive visualizations. [Here](https://mode.com/blog/python-interactive-plot-libraries/), you can find some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll explore [`Bokeh`](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/), which provides lots of nice interactive funtionalities to Python. To work with Bokeh, we first need to do some preparation:\n",
    "1. If you haven't installed it yet please do so. You can simply follow [these steps](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps/installation.html)\n",
    "2. To include Bokeh in your notebooks you can follow the [Bokeh: Using with Jupyter](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/jupyter.html#userguide-jupyter-notebook) guide. Come back to this one when you need it\n",
    "3. We aim to give you a gentle start with Bokeh and I am going to include more example codes than usual in the follwing. However, to get a sense of how things work, I suggest you surf the web, find a Bokeh tutorial and scan through it. Also click around a bit in [the official docs](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide.html#userguide).\n",

In order to fix this look into [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26254619/position-of-the-legend-in-a-bokeh-plot) as a start. Below are some code snippets that you can use to deal with this problem (but read the guide first):\n",

    "    p.add_layout(...., ...) # figure where to add it\n",
    "    # if you read the guide, it will make sense :)\n",
    " ```\n",
